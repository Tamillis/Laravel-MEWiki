# Materium Existentiae Wiki
A wiki for my world building project, which the players are encouraged to use as a reference and to dive deeper into the lore of the games that they play in, and a resource for me to quickly and easily pull on during games as well as during down time.

## Raison d'Ãªtre
To showcase markdown to html conversion, and a pure Laravel project (no Vue or JS framework, minimal pure PHP etc.). The one concession is tailwindcss as I like styling inside my HTML.
The site makes use of a MySQL database, and manual authentication for now but planned laravel's default authentication with user registration where an email is sent to me, for approval to make additions to the site with users being able to make comments on pages.
